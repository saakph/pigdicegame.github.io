            <h3> Pig Dice is a dice game based on greed and luck. </h3>
            <h3> Each player takes turns rolling the dice, and their score is counted as the total of the two dice. However, if a player rolls a single one, nothing is added to their score for that round. If a player rolls double one's, their score is reset to 0. The first person to reach a total score of 100 wins the game! </h3>
